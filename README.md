# Root My Galaxy SM-S918B / SM-S918N

Root My Galaxy v0.4.0 brings KernelSU Next support and exact firmware-profile
selection to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra `SM-S918B` and `SM-S918N` (`dm3q`). This repository
contains the Android app, target configuration, porting sources, patches, and
build tools for the project.

# Root My Galaxy v0.4.0 is here

## Firmware support added in v0.4.0

- New support for firmware `S918BXXSAFZH3`.
- Security patch level: `05/08/2026`.
- The previous `S918BXXSAFZG1` payload remains bundled for older compatible
  devices.

## Validated Target

The Korean `SM-S918N` port is locked to this exact connected-device profile:

```

See [SM-S918N FZH2 Port](docs/TARGET_SM_S918N_FZH2.md) for the recovered
offsets, artifact hashes, and validation status.

## Prerequisites

Before running the port, make sure the phone is ready:

1. **Enable Developer options and USB debugging**.
2. **Enable "Disable child process restrictions"** in Developer options
   (wording varies by One UI version; it sits next to the USB debugging
   toggles). Shizuku needs this to spawn the helper processes the port
   relies on.
3. **Install [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/).** It performs the
   privileged operations this app needs, without a full root shell.
4. **Reboot the phone.** A clean boot avoids stale permission/service state
   and makes the whole flow work on the first try.
5. **Close every other app and background process.** Keep only Shizuku and
   Root My Galaxy running.
6. **Start the Shizuku service**
7. **Open Root My Galaxy** and grant it permission when Shizuku prompts.

The script prints the manual ADB test commands at the end. It does not open a
root shell automatically.

## Quick Start

The Android app uses KernelSU Next v3.3.0 with a profile selected from the
detected firmware. `S918BXXSAFZG1`, `S918BXXSAFZH3`, and `S918NKSS8FZH2` have version-locked
payloads and helpers; see [KernelSU Next AFZG1](kernelsu-next/README.md).

From the repository root:

```sh
./tools/port-sm-s918b-afzf5.sh
```

Build the debug APK:

```sh
./tools/port-sm-s918b-afzf5.sh --build-apk
```

Build, install, and stage local ADB files:

```sh
./tools/port-sm-s918b-afzf5.sh --all
```

## Credits And Base Repository

This SM-S918B port is based on
[youyoudezhuzhu/rmg-f731u](https://github.com/youyoudezhuzhu/rmg-f731u), the
Root-My-Galaxy F731U Z Flip5 payloads + APK repository.

Credit goes to that project for the F731U app/payload baseline, closed helper
flow, KernelSU late-load packaging, support manifest structure, and the porting
procedure used as the starting point for this SM-S918B adaptation.

This repository is an adaptation for `SM-S918B` and `SM-S918N` / `dm3q` with
version-locked firmware profiles, not the original F731U target.
